Modularization is the process of breaking down a system into smaller, independent, and interchangeable modules or components. This approach offers several benefits in software development, system design, and even in manufacturing.

 def find_root_bounds(x, power):
       " " "x a float, power a positive int
return low, high such that low**power <=x and high**power  >= x
" " ""
low = min (-1, x)
high = max (1,x)
return low, high
